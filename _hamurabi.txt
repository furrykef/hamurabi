Bugs
----
The +/- buttons next to the slider do not respect the min/max range of the input.

Should plagues be calculated before or after starvation? Currently done before, so feeding no citizens in a plague year will report only half of the citizenry died of starvation.


Errors in hamurabi.kbs
----------------------
In the rat code, "end if" should precede "S=S-E+H", not follow it.

I believe the test "IF Q=0" (just before "A HORRIBLE PLAGUE STRUCK!") should be "IF Q<0".
